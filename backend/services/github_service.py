# The other functions like get_live_project_details and get_text_content_for_rag
# can remain, but they should now use the user's decrypted token for API calls
# instead of the server's GITHUB_PAT for higher rate limits and access to private repos
# if scope is granted. This is a more advanced step. For now, we'll keep them as is
# for simplicity, using the server's token for public data.
